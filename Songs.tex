The face forgives the mirror\\
The worm forgives the plow\\
The questions begs the answer\\
Can you forgive me somehow?

Maybe when our story's over\\
We'll go where it's always spring\\
The band is playing our song again\\
And all the world is green {[}Play Chorus{]}

The moon is yellow silver\\
On the things that summer brings\\
It's a love you'd kill for\\
And all the world is green

He's balancing a diamond\\
On a blade of grass\\
The dew will settle on our graves\\
When all the world is green

That David played, and it pleased the Lord\\
But you don't really care for music, do ya?\\
Well it goes like this\\
The fourth, the fifth\\
The minor fall and the major lift\\
The baffled king composing Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah (4x)

Well Your faith was strong but you needed proof\\
You saw her bathing on the roof\\
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\\
she tied you to her kitchen chair\\
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair\\
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah (4x)

Well baby I've been here before\\
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\\
I used to live alone before I knew ya\\
I've seen your flag on the marble arch\\
Love is not a victory march\\
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah (4x)

Well there was a time when you let me know\\
What's really going on below\\
But now you never show that to me do you?\\
And remember when I moved in you?\\
And the holy dove was moving too\\
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah (4x)

Well maybe there's a God above\\
But all I've ever learned from love\\
Was how to shoot somebody who'd OUT DREW YA\\
And it's not a cry that you hear at night\\
It's not somebody who's seen in the light\\
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah (repeat\ldots{} hold\ldots)

Bright and early for their daily races\\
Going nowhere, going nowhere\\
Their tears are filling up their glasses\\
No expression, no expression\\
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow\\
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\\
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take\\

Children waiting for the day, they feel good\\
Happy birthday, happy birthday\\
Made to feel the way that every child should\\
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous\\
No one knew me, no one knew me\\
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson\\
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad\\

And you know that she's half crazy\\

And she feeds you tea and oranges\\

And just when you mean to tell\\

her that you have no love to give her\\

And you want to travel with her\\

For you've touched her perfect body\\

And Jesus was a sailor\\
when He walked upon the water\\
And He spent a long time watching\\
from his lonely wooden tower\\
And when He knew for certain\\
only drowning men could see Him\\
He said, ``All men will be sailors\\
then until the sea shall free them''\\
But He Himself was broken\\
long before the sky would open\\
Forsaken, almost human,\\
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him\\
And you want to travel blind\\
And you think maybe you'll trust him\\
For he's touched your perfect body\\
with his mind

Suzanne takes your hand,\\
and she leads you to the river\\
She is wearing rags and feathers\\
from Salvation Army counters\\
And the sun pours down like honey\\
on our lady of the harbor\\
And she shows you where to look\\
among the garbage and the flowers\\
There are heroes in the seaweed,\\
there are children in the morning\\
They are leaning out for love\\
and they will lean that way forever\\
while Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her\\
And you want to travel blind\\
And you know that you will trust her\\
For she's touched your perfect body\\
with her mind

If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do,\\
{[}Am{]} Fmaj7 {[}C{]} {[}G{]}\\
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you.

I was dressed embarrassment.\\
I was dressed in wine.\\
If you had a part of me, will you take you're time?\\
Even if I come back, even if I die\\
Is there some idea to replace my life?

Like a father to impress;\\
Like a mother's mourning dress,\\
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you

I have called you preacher; I have called you son.\\
If you have a father or if you haven't one,\\
I'll do anything for you (4x)

I did everything for you (repeat.. about 8x)
