Chords:
  C - D - G - Em 

(Em)     [C]      [D]
I used to rule the world
          [G]                  [Em]
Seas would rise when I gave the word
                    [C]     [D]
Now in the morning I sleep alone	
         [G]               [Em]
Sweep the streets I used to own

Chords:
  C - D - G - Em    x2

I used to roll the dice 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
Listen as the crowd would sing 
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!" 

One minute I held the key 
Next the walls were closed on me 
And I discovered that my castles stand 
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 

Chorus:
   [C]            [D]
  I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
  [G]          [Em]
  Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
  [C]             [D]
  Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
    [G]               [Em]
  My missionaries in a foreign field
  [C]              [D]
  For some reason I can't explain
  [G]                  [Em]            [C]    [D]
  Once you go there was never, never an honest word
          [Bm]             [Em]
  That was when I ruled the world
  

It was the wicked and wild wind 
Blew down the doors to let me in 
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
People couldn't believe what I'd become 

Revolutionaries wait 
For my head on a silver plate 
Just a puppet on a lonely string 
Oh who would ever want to be king? 

{chorus}
