Standard Tuning, Capo 2nd fret

Intro: G, D, Em, C
       G, D, C   
       2x


G                        D
Headed down south to the land of the pines
        Em                   C
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
G
Starin' up the road
            D         C
And pray to God I see headlights


I made it down the coast in seventeen hours 
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers 
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh 
I can see my baby tonight

Chorus

   G                   D
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Em              C
Rock me mama anyway you feel
G   D     C
Hey, mama rock me
G                     D
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Em                  C
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
G   D     C
Hey, mama rock me


Intro

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now

Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

Chorus

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee

And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me
