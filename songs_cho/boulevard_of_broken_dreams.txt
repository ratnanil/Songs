{artist: Green Day}

[Em]     [G]            [D]            [A]           [Em]
I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
           [G]           [D]              [A]             [Em]
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone

[Em]G][D][A]

I walk this empty street, on the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps, and I'm the only one and I walk alone


[Em][G][D]          [A]         [Em]
         I walk alone, I walk alone.
[Em][G][D]          [A]
         I walk alone, I walk a....

[C]    [G]          [D]            [Em]
    My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
[C]     [G]     [D]             [Em]
    My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
[C]     [G]     [D]               [Em]
    Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
[C]      [G]    [B7]
    Till then I walk alone

Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ahhh-Ah
    [Em] [G]   [D]     [A]
haaa-ah  Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ah-Ah


I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone


[Em]G][D][A]


Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone


I walk alone, I walk alone.
I walk alone, I walk a....

Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ahhh-Ah
haaa-ah  Ah-Ah Ah-Ah  I walk alone, I walk a...
