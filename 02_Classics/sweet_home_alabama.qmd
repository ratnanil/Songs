[D] [Cadd9]       [G]
Big wheels keep on turning
[D]     [Cadd9]        [G]
Carry me home to see my kin
[D]    [Cadd9]         [G]
Singing songs about the south land
[D]     [Cadd9]        [G]                           
I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again and I think it's a sin

[D]             [Cadd9]          [G]
Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her
[D]             [Cadd9]      [G]
Well I heard old Neil put her down
[D]             [Cadd9]    [G]
Well I hope Neil Young will remember
[D]       [Cadd9]            [G]               
[A]outhern man don’t need him around, anyhow

[Chorus]

[D]  [Cadd9] [G]   [D]       [Cadd9]      [G]        
Sweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue
[D]  [Cadd9] [G]   [D]       [Cadd9]       [G]     
Sweet home Alabama, lord I’m coming home to you.

[D]      [Cadd9]           [G]      [F] [C] [D]
In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor, boo-hoo-hoo
[D]       [Cadd9]           [G]
Now we all did what we could do
[D]      [Cadd9]     [G]
Now watergate doesn't bother me
[D]      [Cadd9]          [G]
Does you conscience bother you, (now tell the truth!)

{chorus}

[D][Cadd9]                   [G]
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swappers
[D]             [Cadd9]                 [G]
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes we do)
[D]      [Cadd9]       [G]
Lord they get me off so much
[D]         [Cadd9]            [G]   
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, Now how about you?

{chorus}

[D]  [Cadd9] [G]     
Sweet home Alabama (Oh sweet home baby)
[D]      [Cadd9]      [G]   
Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true)
[D]  [Cadd9] [G]
Sweet Home Alabama, (Lord, yeah)
[D]      [Cadd9]        [G]
Lord, I'm coming home to you
