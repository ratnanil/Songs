Where have all the flowers gone, long time passing
C                  Am            F          G
Where have all the flowers gone, long time ago
C                  Am            F           G
Where have all the flowers gone, young girls picked them every one
F         C                  F         G          C   
When will they ever learn? , when will they ever learn?


C                   Am           F            G
Where have all the young girls gone, Gone to young men every one

C                   Am           F            G
Where have all the young men gone, Gone to soldiers every one

C                   Am           F            G   
Where have all the soldiers gone, Gone to graves every one

C                   Am           F            G  
Where have all the graves gone, Gone to flowers every one.

When will they ever learn? , when will they ever learn?
