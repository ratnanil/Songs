[Am][C]     [D]   [Am]     [C]    [D]     [Am]
   I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
 [C]  [D]      [Am]      [C]    [D]        [Am]
I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
   [C]    [D]     [Am]       [C]    [D]     [Am]
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
      [C]    [D]    [Am]         [C]    [D]    [G]         
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything

:::{.chorus}
[Am]           [F]   [C]             [G]
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
[Am]       [F]           [C]      [G]
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
   [Am]               [F]  [G]             [G]
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
[Am]           [F]    [G]              [Am]
I will let you down    I will make you hurt
:::

I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear
You are someone else   I am still right here

*play chorus*

  [Am]             [F]   [G]            [G]
If I could start again  a million miles away
[Am]           [F]  [G]
I would keep myself  I would find a way
