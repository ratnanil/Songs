[C]            [Dm]
I follow the Moskva
             [C]
Down to Gorky Park
                [Dm]     [Am] [G][C] 
Listening to the wind of change

[C]             [Dm]
An August summer night
                [C]
Soldiers passing by
                [Dm]     [Am] [G][C] 
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change 

[C] [G]       [Dm]         [G]
Take me to the magic of the moment
    [C]   [G]
On a glory night
         [Dm]          [G]           [Am]
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
[F]             [G]
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever


I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Chorus (1st Part):
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

[Am]                     [G]
The wind of change blows straight
                 [Am]
Into the face of time
                          [G]
Like a stormwind that will ring
                             [Am]
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                  [C]
Let your balalaika sing
                       [Em]    [E7]
What my guitar wants to say
