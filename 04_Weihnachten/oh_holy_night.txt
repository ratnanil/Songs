title: Oh Holy Night

---

[C]              [F]                [C]
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
                      [G7]          [C]
It is the night of the dear Saviors birth
[C]                  [F]           [C]
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
         [Em]           [B7]          [Em]
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
 [G7]                [C]           
[A]hrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
   [G7]            [C]               
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

[Am]        [Em]      Dm            [Am]
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
 [C]G7 [C][F]    [C] [G7]              [C]
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
 [G7]     [C][F][C]  [G7]        [C]
O night, O holy night, O night divine

[C]                [F]            [C]
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
                          [G7]      [C]
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
[C]                 [F]          [C]
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
             [Em]          [B7]   [Em]
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
   [G7]              [C]
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
  [G7]           [C]
In all our trials born to be our friend

[Am]        [Em]      Dm            [Am]
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
 [C]G7 [C][F]    [C]   [G7]            [C]
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
 [G7]     [C]F [C]  [G7]        [C]
O night, O holy night, O night divine

[C]                  [F]       [C]
Truly He taught us to love one another;
                       [G7]      [C]
His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
[C]                          [F]          [C]
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
          [Em]       [B7]           [Em]
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
     [G7]            [C]
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
   [G7]          [C]
Let all within us praise His holy Name

[Am]        [Em]      Dm            [Am]
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
 [C]G7   [C]F     [C] [G7]             [C]
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
 [G7]     [C]F [C]  [G7]        [C]
O night, O holy night, O night divine
