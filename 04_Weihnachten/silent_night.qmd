Silent night! Holy night! All is calm all is bright 
Round yon virgin mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace! Sleep in heavenly peace!

Silent night! Holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born! Christ the Saviour is born!

Silent night! Holy night! Son of God love's pure light 
Radiant beams from thy holy face With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus lord at thy birth! Jesus lord at thy birth!
