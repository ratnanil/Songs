Silent night! Holy night! 
All is calm all is bright 
Round yon virgin mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild 
Sleep in heavenly peace! (2x)

Silent night! Holy night! 
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar 
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born! (2x)

Silent night! Holy night! 
Son of God love's pure light 
Radiant beams from thy holy face 
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus lord at thy birth! (2x)
