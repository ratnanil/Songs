Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible says,  
Mary's boychild, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark now! Hear the Angels sing, a King was born today, 
and man will live forever more because of Christmas Day. 
{end_of_chorus}  

While shepherds watch their flocks by night, 
they see a bright new shining star. 
They hear a choir sing a song,  
the music seemed to come from afar.  
  
{chorus} 

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night. 
They found no place to bear the child,  
not a single room was in sight.      
  
{chorus}

Trumpets sound and Angels sing...listen to what they say, 
that man will live forever more because of Christmas Day.

{chorus}
  
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn. 
And in a manger, cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible says,  
Mary's boychild, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day. 

  
{chorus}

Trumpets sound and Angels sing...listen to what they say, 
that man will live forever more because of Christmas Day.
