[Bm]                         [D]
I know I can't take one more step towards you
[A]                           [Em]
'Cause all thats waiting is regret
[Bm]                            [D]
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
[A]                           [G]
You lost the love I loved the most
[Em]              [D]    [A]
I learned to live half a life
[Em]        [D]           [Asus4][A]
And now you want me one more time

{start_of_chorus}
[D]                  [A]
Who do you think you are?
                       [Bm]
Running 'round leaving scars
                     [G]
Collecting a jar of hearts
 Gm           [D]
Tearing love apart
[D]                  [A]
You're gonna catch a cold
                         [Bm]
From the ice inside your soul
                    [G]
Don't come back for me
Gm                   [D]
Who do you think you are?

{end_of_chorus}

[Bm]                      [D]
I hear you're asking all around
[A]                     [Em]
If I am anywhere to be found
[Bm]                  [D]
But I have grown too strong
[A]                       [G]
To ever fall back in your arms
[Em]                 [D]    [A]
I've learned to live half a life
[Em]        [D]          [Asus4][A]
And now you want me one more time

{chorus}

[Bm]       [F#]         [D]     [E]
It took so long just to feel alright
 [Bm]          [F#]           [D]        [E]
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
  [Bm]        [F#]            [D]           [E]
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
       [Bm]      [F#]     [D]   [E]
'Cause you broke all your promises
    [G]
And now you're back
                [F#]
You don't get to get me back

{chorus}

Gm                    [D]
Who do you think you are?
Gm                    [D]
Who do you think you are?
Gm                    [D]
Who do you think you are?
