[G]                     [D]
Headed down south to the land of the pines
       [Em]                 [C]
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
[G]
Starin' up the road
           [D]       [C]
And pray to God I see headlights


I made it down the coast in seventeen hours 
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers 
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh 
I can see my baby tonight

{start_of_chorus}
  [G]                 [D]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
[Em]           [C]
Rock me mama anyway you feel
[G][D]   [C]
Hey, mama rock me
[G]                  [D]
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
[Em]               [C]
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
[G][D]   [C]
Hey, mama rock me

Intro

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now

Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

{chorus}

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee

And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

{chorus}
