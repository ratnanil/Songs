[Am]         Fmaj7    [C]             [G]
I have called you children, I have called you son,
[Am]        Fmaj7     [C]         [G]
What is there to answer when I'm the only one?
[Am]        Fmaj7   [C]           [G]
Morning comes in paradise, morning comes in light,
[Am]    Fmaj7   [C] [G]
Still I must obey, still I must invite.

          [Am]       Fmaj7       [C]  [G]
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do,
          [Am]     Fmaj7  [C]      [G]
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you.

I was dressed embarrassment. 
I was dressed in wine. 
If you had a part of me, will you take you're time? 
Even if I come back, even if I die 
Is there some idea to replace my life? 

Like a father to impress; 
Like a mother's mourning dress, 
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you 

I have called you preacher; I have called you son. 
If you have a father or if you haven't one, 
I'll do anything for you (4x)

I did everything for you (repeat.. about 8x)
