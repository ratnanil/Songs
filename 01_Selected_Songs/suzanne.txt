[E]              
Suzanne takes you down
to her place by the river
        [F#m]           
You can hear the boats go by,
you can spend the night beside herw
         [E]                   
And you know that she's half crazy
but that's why you want to be there
         G#m            
And she feeds you tea and oranges
          [A]               
that come all the way from China
     [E]
And just when you mean to tell
            [F#m]
her that you have no love to give her
         [E]
Then she gets you on her wavelength
        [F#m]
And she lets the river answer                        
             [E]
that you've always been her lover
         [G#m]
And you want to travel with her
        [A]
And you want to travel blind
         [E]
And you know that she will trust you
            [F#m]       
For you've touched her perfect body                 
          [E]
with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
when He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching
from his lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
only drowning men could see Him
He said, "All men will be sailors
then until the sea shall free them"
But He Himself was broken
long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body 
with his mind

Suzanne takes your hand,
and she leads you to the river   
She is wearing rags and feathers
from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look 
among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, 
there are children in the morning    
They are leaning out for love 
and they will lean that way forever   
while Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you will trust her
For she's touched your perfect body 
with her mind
