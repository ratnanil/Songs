\begin{verbatim}

Intro : Em Bm Em Bm Am Bm Em

Em                Bm
I'm Sitting Here In A Boring Room
Em                             Bm
It's Just Another Rainy Sunday Afternoon
Em                        Bm
I'm Wasting My Time I Got Nothing To Do
Em                     Bm
I'm Hanging Around I'm Waiting For You
    Am                   Bm      Em
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

I'm Driving Around In My Car
I'm Driving Too Fast I'm Driving Too Far
I'd Like To Change My Point Of View
I Feel So Lonely I'm Waiting For You
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

Chorus
G              D
I Wonder How I Wonder Why
Em                              Bm
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky
C                  D                    G         D
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
G                   D
I'm Turning My Head Up And Down
 Em                                  Bm
 I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around
C                  A                    D
And All That I Can See Is Just another Lemon-tree

Bridge : Em Bm Em Bm Am Bm Em
         dadada....

I'm Sitting Here I Miss The Power
I'd Like To Go Out Taking A Shower
But There's A Heavy Cloud Inside My Head
I Feel So Tired Put Myself Into Bed
Where Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

B           Em
Isolation - Is Not Good For Me
D           G               B
Isolation - I Don't Want To Sit On A Lemon-tree

I'm Steppin' Around In A Desert Of Joy
Baby Anyhow I'll Get Another Toy
And Everything Will Happen - And You'll Wonder

Chorus 2x

C                  D
And All That I Can See
C                  D
And All That I Can See
C                  D
And All That I Can See
                 G
Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree.
