## Jar of Hearts - Christina Perri
```{}
Bm                            D
I know I can't take one more step towards you
A                              Em
'Cause all thats waiting is regret
Bm                               D
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
A                              G
You lost the love I loved the most
Em                 D      A
I learned to live half a life
Em           D             Asus4  A
And now you want me one more time

Chorus
D                     A
Who do you think you are?
                        Bm
Running 'round leaving scars
                      G
Collecting a jar of hearts
 Gm            D
Tearing love apart
D                     A
You're gonna catch a cold
                          Bm
From the ice inside your soul
                     G
Don't come back for me
Gm                    D
Who do you think you are?


Bm                         D
I hear you're asking all around
A                        Em
If I am anywhere to be found
Bm                     D
But I have grown too strong
A                          G
To ever fall back in your arms
Em                    D      A
I've learned to live half a life
Em           D            Asus4  A
And now you want me one more time

Chorus

Bm          F#           D       E
It took so long just to feel alright
  Bm            F#             D          E
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
   Bm          F#              D             E
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
        Bm        F#       D     E
'Cause you broke all your promises
     G
And now you're back
                 F#
You don't get to get me back

Chorus (...Don't come back at all) x2

Gm                     D
Who do you think you are?
Gm                     D
Who do you think you are?
Gm                     D
Who do you think you are? 

```
