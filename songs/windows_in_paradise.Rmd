\section{For the Windows in Paradise - Sufjan Stevens}

\begin{verbatim}
\emph{Capo: 2nd Fret}

Am	          Fmaj7	    C	              G
I have called you children, I have called you son,
Am	         Fmaj7	     C	          G
What is there to answer when I'm the only one?
Am	         Fmaj7	   C	            G
Morning comes in paradise, morning comes in light,
Am	     Fmaj7	   C	  G
Still I must obey, still I must invite.
\setlength{\parindent}{\chorus}
           Am	       Fmaj7	       C	   G
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do,
           Am	     Fmaj7	  C	       G
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you.

I was dressed embarrassment. 
I was dressed in wine. 
If you had a part of me, will you take you're time? 
Even if I come back, even if I die 
Is there some idea to replace my life? 

Like a father to impress; 
Like a mother's mourning dress, 
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you 

I have called you preacher; I have called you son. 
If you have a father or if you haven't one, 
I'll do anything for you (4x)

I did everything for you (repeat.. about 8x)
