(Into F with F-C note progression beginning)

Verse One:
C (G root note)

Love of mine
                 Am (D root note)
Someday you will die
                      F 
But I will be close behind
           C                  G
I will follow, you into the dark

No blinding light
Or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for, the hint of a spark 

Chorus: 
   Am                 C      
If heaven and hell decide,      
           F           C G
that they both are satisfied
Am               C                 G(bar)
Illuminate the "no's", on their vacancy signs
Am                        C
If there's no one beside you,
           E      Am G
when your soul embarks
Bb                 Bbm            F (C root note)
Then I will follow you into the dark


Catholic school
As vicious as roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised 
By a lady in black
     
And I held my tongue 
as she told me "son, fear is the heart of love." 
So I never went back

Chorus

You and me, have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary  
And the soles of your shoes
 
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about  
Because we'll hold each other soon
Am                   Fm    Fm
in the blackest of rooms 

Am                   C     
If heaven and hell decide, 
           F            C G
that they both are satisfied
Am               C                 G(bar)
Illuminate the "no's", on their vacancy signs
Am                        C              E      Am G
If there's no one beside you, when your soul embarks
F                 Fm            C    
Then I will follow you into the dark
